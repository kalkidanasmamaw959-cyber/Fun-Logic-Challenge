# Fun Logic Challenge

A small browser-based logic puzzle project built for the GDG mini-project showcase.

## Overview

Fun Logic Challenge is a lightweight web project that presents logic puzzles and interactive challenges in the browser. It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it runs locally without build tools.

## Features

- Simple, interactive logic puzzles implemented in `index.html` and `script.js`.
- Responsive styling with `style.css`.
- No dependencies — just open the HTML file in a browser.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

	`git clone <repository-url>`

2. Open the project folder and launch the app by opening `index.html` in your browser.

	- Double-click `index.html`, or
	- Run a simple static server, for example:

	```bash
	# using Python 3
	python -m http.server 8000

	# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
	```

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML page for the puzzles and UI.
